# File System Organizer Using Node.Js
- This project is used for organizing file system in a better way.
- It organizes file according to their file type (like media, documents, archives etc) in a folder containing sub folders of file category type.
- Example -: I have ('.txt', '.mp3' ) files so there are organized in a folder named 'media' and 'image' which are in folder named 'organised'.
- This is done using Node.js modules like path and fs module.

- This file organizer can be used by typing following commands on terminal -:
# node main.js organize "directory path"

- 1) main.js -> It is main file in which code is present. So { node main.js } will run this file.
- 2)  "organize" is command name which we want to execute.
- 3) "directory path" is path of directory/folder which we want to organize.
